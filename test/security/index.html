    <p class="lead">
      Trix Embed ships with a few security features to help prevent malicious and unwanted content from being embedded.
    </p>

    <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
      All security attributes are removed from the DOM when the controller connects,
      and all security values are discarded when the controller disconnects.
    </div>

    <h2>🗂️ Files</h2>
    <p>
      Traditional file attachments by any means are disabled.
      This includes pasting, dragging, and dropping.
    </p>

    <h2>✅ Allow List</h2>
    <p>
      Allow lists let you specify which hosts and domains can be embedded.
      The lists are encrypted and hidden making it difficult for attackers to tamper with them.
    </p>

    <h2>😱 Paranoid</h2>
    <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
      Paranoid mode is enabled by default.
    </div>
    <p>
